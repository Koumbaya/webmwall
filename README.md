# webmwall
A full screen webm/images wall display. When launched in a folder it opens up a web server that displays the content of the folder in an alternating grid layout that's auto scrolling. Speed, columns and file filters can be adjusted via the UI.

Mostly an experiment to test copilot capabilities, took me waaayyyyy too many prompts to get exactly what I wanted, would probably have been better off writing it myself.
